# Cyto-CommGCN 
Clustering Spatial Transcriptomics Data Based on Cell-Cell Communication Information and Identification of Domain-Specific Ligand-Receptor Pairs
## Introduction
Spatial transcriptomics provides a new perspective to explore biological signals with gene expression and spatial information. However, relying solely on the transcriptome level remains limited for achieving accurate clustering of spatial transcriptomics data, particularly in tumor datasets. To address this issue, we developed Cyto-CommGCN, a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based method that integrates gene expression information with cell-cell communication data. 

With Cyto-CommGCN, you can:

*· By leveraging the GCN framework and iterative clustering, Cyto-CommGCN can accurately detect spatial domains within tumor datasets and identify meaningful ligand-receptor pairs involved in critical signaling pathways.
*·
